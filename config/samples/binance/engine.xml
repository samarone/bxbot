    <!--
    A unique identifier for the bot. The is used by BX-bot UI Server to identify the bot. Value must be an alphanumeric
    string. Underscores and dashes are also permitted. E.g. my-bot_1
    -->
    <bot-id>my-binance-bot_1</bot-id>

    <!--
    A friendly name for the bot. The is used by BX-bot UI to display the bot's name. Value must be an alphanumeric
    string. Spaces are allowed. E.g. My Super Bot
    -->
    <bot-name>Binance Bot</bot-name>

    <!--
    The <emergency-stop-currency> value must be set to prevent catastrophic loss on the exchange.
    This is normally the currency you intend to hold a long position in. It should be set to the currency short code for the
    wallet, e.g. BTC, LTC, USD. This value can be case sensitive for some exchanges - check the Exchange Adapter documentation.
    -->
    <emergency-stop-currency>USDT</emergency-stop-currency>

    <!--
    The <emergency-stop-balance> value must be set to prevent a catastrophic loss on the trading.
    The Trading Engine checks this value at the start of every trade cycle: if your <emergency-stop-currency> balance on
    the trading drops below this value, the Trading Engine will stop trading on all markets and shutdown.
    Manual intervention is then required to restart the bot. You can set this value to 0 to override this check.
    -->
    <emergency-stop-balance>1000</emergency-stop-balance>

    <!--
    The <trade-cycle-interval> value is the interval in seconds that the Trading Engine will wait/sleep before executing
    the next trade cycle. The minimum value is 1 second. Some exchanges allow you to hit them harder than others. However,
    while their API documentation might say one thing, the reality is you might get socket timeouts and 5XX responses if you
    hit it too hard - you cannot perform low latency trading over the public internet ;-)
    You'll need to experiment with the trade cycle interval for different exchanges.

    <trade-cycle-interval>20</trade-cycle-interval>
