    <!--
    For the adapter value, you must specify the fully qualified name of your Exchange Adapter class so the Trading Engine
    can load and execute it. The class must be on the runtime classpath.

        This value is in SECONDS. It is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket connect/socket read
        when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached, the exchange adapter will give up and
        throw a Trading API TimeoutException.

        The exchange adapter is single threaded: if one request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent requests from
        getting to the exchange. This timeout prevents an indefinite block.

        You'll need to experiment with values here.
